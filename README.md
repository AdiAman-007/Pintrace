* Pintraceâ€“ will help us track parts/products across its entire lifecycle in supply-chain
network.
* Two parties are involved- Manufacturer, and Supplier.
* Manufacturer- deals with manufacturing of products, for which parts are required.
These parts are provided by the supplier. A manufacturer can create a request for the
required parts.
* Supplier- deals with supplying the parts. When a manufacturer creates a request for
parts, the request goes to a supplier. The supplier can fulfill the request based on the
availability of the parts.
* Once, the manufacturer received the parts from the supplier, they can proceed on
building the finished product.
